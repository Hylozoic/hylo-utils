# Hylo.com shared modules

## For Development

1. Edit code in `src/` and build using `yarn build` (or `yarn start` to continuously build)
2. `yarn test` to run tests
3. To test changes in a project run `yarn link` in the root of this project, then in the root of the target project (e.g. `hylo-evo` or `HyloReactNative`) run `yarn link hylo-shared`. Your changes should now be available within that project wherever you've imported this library. 

## For Release

Once you've completed, tested, committed and pushed changes and are ready to make a new release:

1. Commit changes and `git push`
2. Run `npm version <patch|minor|major>`. **⚠️ patch versions should never have breaking changes from previous version**
3. Run `yarn build` 
4. Run `git push --tags` to push the version tags to the origin
5. Run `npm publish` to publish this new version to the NPM registry. This should be published under the `hylodevs` NPM account (see password manager for needed credentials)
